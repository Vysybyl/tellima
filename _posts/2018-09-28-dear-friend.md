My Dear Friend,

I hope this one finds you well. 

I have been thinking of you a lot, lately. Actually, I think about you all the time. I can't but thinking of you.

My wondering thoughts haven't brought me anywhere far, but here are a few things I have found close to my heart.

You are not alone. I can't really tell the last time we met (did we meet for real, anyway?) but I'm certain that you are surrounded by the right people. Even if this words find you lost in the deepest of our last forests or sailing lonely in the middle of a dark ocean, I'm there with you.

If you then miss someone who's departed or lost in your past, hearten yourself, for they are with you. Even when they were present, the two of you were no more separated then now. Ask them whatever you want and trust their reply - shall it be a voice in your heart or a sign carved in sand.

Do not despair. We are all with you. If you feel that your strenghts are fading, that your burden is too heavy, that you are not wise enough to take the right decision: take a deep breath and trust me even just a little. There is no better person to take this weight, no wiser or stronger one to carry on. 

Trust the path that has put you there. Be simple and please remind me to be as such.

Even if your hands do not move anymore or your voice shakes, that little power that you feel will be enough. 

First: be kind to yourself and to your heart. 

Then take care of anything urgent.

Once you've done that, take care of others. 

I'm doing it myself at my best.

I promise you: what now seems unjust or ruthless will be flooded with light. I entrust you your next step. I know you won't let me down.

I won't.

May your touch be gentle.

Yours,
