While the storm buzzes off down the street

and the other chimps' yackety-yak grows back

'bout what that monkey did do the other monkeys said to see

I'm flashed by all those pieces of heart collected around the sphere

faithful sad young faces nodding their beliefs to the last steps of the dark dance ending upon us all

and I wonder if sparkles those are not of dying hopes

but the subtle omens of things getting prepared to soon be seen

for I know you are with me
