What if all those rattling thoughts  
that keep on carrying you along  
were nothing but echoes  
by past generations born?

What if the cravings for this  
or that - for love or sex -  
proceeded from the tides  
or radio waves, as secondary effects?

What if even your dearest prides,  
your righteous indignation  
and radiant compassion  
had no causation  

but the laws of rhyme,  
analogy,  
rythm and repetition?  

Would you trust yourself  
to the hands of your self  
knowing that the gentlest chimes  
that rings behind  
your furthest memory  
of childhood times  
were struck and scattered  
by a breath that's blown  
now, out of the present moment,  
out of this body you call your own?
