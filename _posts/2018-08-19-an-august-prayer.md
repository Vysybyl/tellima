May the carriage curtains fall down on this naked city  
Finding myself with dull breaths on my chest  
With dull thoughts gritting my teeth:

>  "I am not good!  
>   I'm a liar and a cheat!"

May I lick them round with my muscle  
Pebble them down my throat  
to my precious chicken tummy.   
Let me digest them, make 'em ring:

>  "Unconditional love!  
>   Truth! Justice!"

...let me sing. Or even:

>  "Mild awareness!  
>   Glimpse of ore!  
>  *Watanabe no kanto*  
>  *Watanase no* more!"

Toes, fingers and sand,  
we'll arrive to Rewind Station,  
a Chattanooga choo-choo rolling through the mouth once again:

>  "I've lost the last refrain!  
>	  I've lost another friend!"

Stop! - I will scream - Set me free!  
It's the billion thousandth time   
this tin-top cart crosses Zion II  
without disembarking me!

All silent passengers echo my call  
*Watanabe no kanto* - one says.  

>  "*Watanase no* more."

Now I see.

They flicker their faded tickets, exchange them.  
We stand or sit still.  
Our sight never reaches our hands,  
grasping our selves, the tin structure and me.  

A normalized pack.  
We spin plexiglass wheels on knitted rails rushing through the land of mirrors.  
We can not touch.  

So please please please, I pray,  
may the circles I see on other people's heads  
drop gently off my black hair.  
Now, or soon, or at least somewhere else
